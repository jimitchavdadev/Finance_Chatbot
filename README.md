# Finance Chatbot Web App

## üìå Objective

The **Finance Chatbot Web App** is a Flask-based interactive chatbot designed to provide financial advice, stock data, loan calculations, and budget analysis. It enables users to ask financial questions and receive AI-driven responses in a user-friendly web interface. The chatbot can:

- Explain financial concepts in simple terms.
- Retrieve real-time stock market data.
- Perform loan payment and investment calculations.
- Provide budgeting and saving insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Backend (Flask & Python)**

- The Flask server (`app.py`) serves the frontend and processes chatbot queries.
- `Finance_Chatbot.py` contains the **FinancialAdvisorBot**, which handles financial-related queries.
- The bot interacts with external APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance) for real-time stock data.
- Flask exposes an API endpoint (`/query`) where the frontend sends user queries.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**

- `index.html` provides a chat-based UI.
- `style.css` ensures a clean, modern, and responsive design.
- `script.js` manages user interactions, sends queries to the backend, and formats chatbot responses.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Chat Flow**

1. User types a question into the input field.
2. The JavaScript code (`script.js`) sends the question to the Flask backend via an API request.
3. The backend processes the query using `Finance_Chatbot.py`, performs necessary calculations, or fetches stock data.
4. The chatbot responds, and the UI displays the formatted message.
